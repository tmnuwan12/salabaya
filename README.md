# salabaya
Java based utility to provide you helpful CLI commands to get things done when you are offline.

Please note the commands already added to the tools are the ones I find useful in day to day life
of a developer. If you need to add commands of you own you can add them in the _commands.yml_ file.


## To run the application:

1. First build the jar by using mvn clean install
2. Fat jar is located under _target/salabaya-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar_
3. Execute the above jar file
4. List of aliases will be shown when running the program.
5. Type the alias then press return to get the full command (command will also get copied to clipboard).
